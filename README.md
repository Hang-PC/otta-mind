Otta-Mind is a simple and intuitive app designed to help you stop overthinking and take immediate action. By letting you jot down your thoughts and randomly selecting one to focus on, Otta-Mind encourages clarity and decisiveness. The name "Otta-Mind" comes from the idea of having a "single mind" focus.
